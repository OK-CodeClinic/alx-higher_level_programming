# Python - Almost a circle

### **General Knowledge**
**In this project, i started learning;**
1. What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
2. How to serialize and deserialize a Class
3. How to write and read a JSON file
4. What is *args and how to use it
5. What is **kwargs and how to use it
6. How to handle named arguments in a function
7. JSON encoder and decoder
9. Unittest module
8. Python test cheatsheet


###
In this project, i build my skills more in OOP by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the unittest module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes are utilized the following OOP tools;
1. Import
2. Exceptions
3. Private attributes
4. Getter/setter
5. Class/static methods
6. Inheritance
7. File I/O
8. args/kwargs
9. JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization
10. Unittesting

## Requirements
### Python requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder ```tests```
- All your test files should be text files (extension: ```.txt)```
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: ```python3 -m doctest ./tests/*```
- All your modules should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')```
- All your classes should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')```
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation ```(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'``` and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')```
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### Python Unit Tests
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start with test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
