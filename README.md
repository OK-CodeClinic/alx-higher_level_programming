# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX School of Software Engineering. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the foundatrion year curriculum, I learned Python, MySQL and JavaScript.

- 0x00. Python - Hello, World
